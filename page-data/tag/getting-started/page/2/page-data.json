hundreds of\ntutorials.\n\nZapier\nOn top of this, you can connect your Ghost site to more than 1,000 external\nservices using the official integration with Zapier [https://zapier.com].\n\nZapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create\nand customise a wide range of connected applications.\n\n> Example: When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger)\nthen the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).\nHere are the most popular Ghost<>Zapier automation templates: \n\nCustom integrations\nAt the heart of Ghost sits a robust JSON API – designed to create, manage and\nretrieve content with ease. \n\nIt's possible to create custom Ghost integrations with dedicated API keys and\nwebhooks from the Integrations page within Ghost Admin. \n\nBeyond that, the API allows you to build entirely custom publishing apps. You\ncan send content from your favourite desktop editor, build a custom interface\nfor handling editorial workflow or use Ghost as a full headless CMS with a\ncustom front-end.\n\nThe Ghost API is thoroughly documented [https://ghost.org/docs/api/] and\nstraightforward to work with for developers of almost any level. \n\nFinal step: Themes\nAlright, on to the last post in our welcome-series!
